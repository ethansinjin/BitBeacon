**security:**

breadwallet represents a major step forward in bitcoin wallet security. It is
designed to be secure against malware, security issues with other apps, and
even physical theft. It makes full use of the security features provided by iOS,
including AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing and data protection, code
signing, and keychain services.

**reliability:**

Unlike other iOS bitcoin wallets, breadwallet is a real bitcoin client. There
are no external web services or servers to get hacked or go down, so you always
have access to your money. It uses "simplified payment verification" or
[SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode
to retrive data directly from the bitcoin network with the fast performance you
need in a mobile environment.

**convenience:**

Your entire wallet is backed up with a single convenient backup phrase that
will work forever. If your device is ever lost or broken, use your backup
phrase to restore your balance and transaction history on another device. This
is possible because breadwallet is a 
[BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
"deterministic" wallet, meaning that all your bitcoin addresses and private
keys are generated from a single "seed".

**WARNING:** installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data
and rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8)
and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its
.entitlements file.
